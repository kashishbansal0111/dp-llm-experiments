- `target_epsilon=3.0`: Chosen as a moderate value for sensitive healthcare data. It provides a stronger privacy guarantee than higher values (e.g., 5-10) sometimes used, but is likely sufficient to allow the Logistic Regression model to learn meaningful patterns from the ~14.5k samples, representing a pragmatic privacy-utility trade-off.
- `target_delta=1e-5`: This is a standard, cryptographically small value, significantly less than 1/N (1/14523 ≈ 6.9e-5), ensuring a robust privacy guarantee where the probability of the guarantee failing is minimal.
- `max_grad_norm=5.0`: This value assumes features are appropriately scaled (e.g., StandardScaler) prior to training, which is crucial for stabilizing gradients. Given the target variable 'readmitted' is balanced, the primary concern shifts from protecting rare class gradients to finding a general balance. A value of 5.0 is higher than typical defaults (like 1.0), allowing for potentially more informative gradient updates and faster convergence compared to overly aggressive clipping, while still bounding the influence of individual data points as required by DP-SGD. It avoids extremely high values that might require excessive noise for the chosen epsilon. This choice reflects a balance between preserving gradient information (post-scaling) and limiting individual sensitivity.
- `Preprocessing`: Scaling is explicitly highlighted as essential for `max_grad_norm` effectiveness and general LR performance. Encoding categorical features is necessary for the model."

This value is higher than the lower end of the range (1.0) to allow for more accurate model training while still providing a reasonable level of privacy. The target delta is set to '1/N' to minimize the probability of a privacy breach. The max grad norm is set to 10.0 to preserve minority class signals and ensure stable gradient computations. Normalization using StandardScaler and encoding categorical variables are suggested to improve model performance. Column sensitivity epsilon values are assigned based on the potential identifiability and sensitivity of each feature, with higher values indicating greater sensitivity."

Delta chosen as 1e-5 (smaller than 1/N=6.88e-5) to prioritize privacy. Max_grad_norm=5.0 balances gradient stability and minority class preservation: post-scaling gradients need sufficient range to capture patterns in balanced classes while preventing outlier dominance. High sensitivity scores (1.0) assigned to demographics (race/gender), diagnoses, and medications due to identifiability risks. Mid-range (0.5-0.8) for procedural counts and less specific identifiers. Scaling ensures numerical features contribute proportionally, avoiding skewed gradient magnitudes. The clip norm avoids aggressive clipping that could suppress rare but valid patterns in balanced classes."

* **`target_epsilon` = 3.0:**  This value provides a reasonable level of privacy protection for healthcare data, considering its sensitive nature. A higher epsilon allows for more utility in the model, but at the cost of increased privacy risk. 
* **`target_delta` = 1e-6:** This small value ensures a very low probability of significant privacy breaches. 
* **`max_grad_norm` = 10.0:** Given the class imbalance in the dataset, a higher clipping value is necessary to prevent the model from being overly sensitive to gradients from the majority class. This helps ensure that the model learns effectively from the minority class samples. 

The `column_sensitivity_epsilon` values are assigned based on the potential identifiability of each feature. Features like 'age', 'admission_type_id', and 'diag_1' are assigned higher sensitivity values as they could potentially be more revealing about an individual's identity. 

Normalization is crucial for Logistic Regression to prevent features with different scales from dominating the learning process. Gradient clipping helps stabilize the training process, especially in the presence of class imbalance, by preventing excessively large gradients from disproportionately affecting the model's updates."

Target_delta is set to 1e-5, which is appropriate given the dataset size (N=14523). The max_grad_norm of 10.0 ensures that gradients are stable while preserving minority class signals, given the balanced target variable. Column sensitivity epsilons reflect the relative identifiability of features, with higher values for more sensitive attributes like race, gender, max_glu_serum, and A1Cresult. Normalization is crucial for stable gradient computations, especially with DP-SGD."
